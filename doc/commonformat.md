Common JSON format
------------------

The intention is to define format general enough to transit modification events of different databases.

CommonFormatEvent structure has the following fields:

  * Type - type of event: insert, delete, schema. updates is produces as delete/insert pair
  * Key - primary key of the row, encoded as an array
  * SeqNo - event sequence number generated by the reader
  * Timestamp - timestamp of the moment when event generated by the reader
  * Fields - Array of name/value pairs, empty for delete event

Import [types/format.go](../types/format.go) in order to unmarshal events in Golang.

## Examples of events:

### Insert event:
```json
{   "Type":"insert",
    "Key":["part1","part2"],
    "SeqNo":123,
    "Timestamp":1494315140,
    "Fields": [
        {"Name":"f1","Value":1},
        {"Name":"f3","Value":"string field"},
        {"Name":"f4","Value":null}
    ]
}
```
### Delete event:
```json
{ "Type":"delete", "Key":["key1"], "SeqNo":124, "Timestamp":1494315140}
```

### Schema event:
```json
{"Type":"schema","Key":["f1"],"SeqNo":125,"Timestamp":1494315140,"Fields":[{"Name":"f1","Value":"int(11)"},{"Name":"f3","Value":"int(11)"},{"Name":"f4","Value":"int(11)"}]}
```
